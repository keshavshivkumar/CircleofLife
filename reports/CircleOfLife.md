## Overview

- Circle of Life is the second project under the Rutgers' CS-520 class taught by Dr. Charles Cowan.
- The project aims to understand how to build a probabalistic model of decision making for an agent in an environment to catch a prey while also avoiding a predator.
- The agent is provided different levels of information of the prey and predator, and must use the information to make decisions.

## Analysis

- The smallest number of edges you can add in the graph is 10.
